# Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) Modeling Library
> (implementations in Python and Mathematica)

The goal is to provide functions and examples for FCM model. Primary Python code for modeling fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs). Focus is on the following functionalities:
  - Representation
  - Visualization
  - Evolution
  - knowledge Combination

The initial functions and models were built in Mathematica. Later models were built with a Python version of FCM library. So some of the more advanced functionality show up in the Mathematica library first (e.g. asynchronous map evolution & knowledge fusion).

Key functions and classes for both implementations in the [lib](./lib/) folder. Older [checkpoint versions](./lib/old-vers/) retained for replication purposes.

This repository also contains some sample specifications for FCMs from prior literature. E.g. for Blood clot formation (discussed in [Taber et. al.](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1190436)).
